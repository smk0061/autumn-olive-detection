## Overview

Autumn olive is an invasive shrub that dominates reclaimed surface mines across the eastern United States. This project uses multispectral and RGB imagery from a Sentera 6X sensor mounted on a DJI Matrice 300 RTK to classify autumn olive across four phenological stages (early, peak, late, senescence) at two sites in West Virginia.

The pipeline uses two complementary approaches:

- **Random forest** — pixel-level classification from 5 spectral bands and 15 vegetation indices. Permutation importance and SHAP analysis identify the most discriminative indices for each phenological stage, which then inform the input selection for the U-Net models.
- **U-Net** — semantic segmentation of 256x256 image chips in three input configurations: RGB (3-band), multispectral (5-band), and vegetation index composite (8-band, using the top indices identified by the random forest analysis).

The best-performing model was the **peak-stage RGB U-Net** with 96.7% overall accuracy and an autumn olive F1-score of 0.927.

## Pipeline

1. **Radiometric correction** — Sentera 6X post-processing script (ILS + calibration panel)
2. **Orthomosaic generation** — Agisoft Metashape (3 cm/px multispectral, 1.5 cm/px RGB)
3. **Vegetation indices** — `vegetation_indices.py` (raster) or `tabular_vegetation_indices.R` (tabular for RF)
4. **Point sampling** — RF training data extracted via buffered GPS points (0.1m radius) in ArcGIS Pro 3.4
5. **Random forest classification** — `random_forest.R` performs balanced sampling, VIF assessment, grid search, and feature importance analysis
6. **Image chipping** — `image_chipper.py` creates 256x256 chips with 50% overlap, rasterizes annotation shapefiles into class masks
7. **Normalization** — `chip_normalization.py` applies flight-specific z-score normalization for RGB and VI-composite inputs. Multispectral data is radiometrically calibrated by the sensor.
8. **U-Net training** — `unet_training.py` trains segmentation models with weighted focal loss, OneCycleLR scheduling, and early stopping
9. **Inference** — `unet_prediction.py` applies trained models to full orthomosaics using tiled inference with overlap blending

## Using the Trained Model

```python
# in unet_prediction.py, set:
MODEL_PATH = "03_segmentation/unet_rgb_peak_best.pth"
MODEL_TYPE = "rgb"
INPUT_IMAGE = "path/to/orthomosaic.tif"
OUTPUT_DIR = "path/to/output"
```

Outputs a georeferenced class prediction raster, confidence map, and color visualization.
